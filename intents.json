It's a feeling of fear or apprehension about what's to come. The first day of school, going to a job interview, or giving a speech may cause most people to feel fearful and nervous. We all get anxious sometimes, but anxiety becomes a problem when it starts affecting your daily life drastically. The best thing that you can do to help reduce anxiety is to take a few deep breaths and talk to someone about what you're feeling. Some natural remedies that you can try include: getting enough sleep meditating, staying active and exercising, eating a healthy diet, staying active and working out, avoiding alcohol, avoiding caffeine, and quitting smoking cigarettes. Support your friends and loved ones by checking up on them and just listening. Whatever you're feeling is valid."

However, the difference in sadness and depression lies in the duration and magnitude of the problem.

                "Persistent Depressive Disorder is a less severe form of depression. Although less extreme, Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD) causes chronic or long-lasting moodiness that ranges in severity. It is marked by a depressed mood for most of the day, for more days than not, for at least 2 years. In children and teens, moods can be irritable for at least 1 year to be called Persistent Depressive Disorder. 
                PDD can occur alone or with other psychiatric or mood disorders, although not with mania or hypomania. As with depression, PDD is more common in women than in men. A family history of mood disorders is not uncommon. This mood disorder tends to appear earlier than major depression, although it can begin anytime from childhood to later in life.
                Symptoms of Persistent Depressive Disorder:
                                                            Feelings of hopelessness or helplessness
                                                            Trouble sleeping or daytime sleepiness
                                                            Poor appetite or eating too much
                                                            Poor concentration
                                                            Fatigue or low energy
                                                            Low self-esteem
                                                            Trouble concentrating or making decisions
                Treatment:
                            Antidepressants, such as selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), or tricyclic antidepressants, are often used to treat PDD. Because you may need to continue treatment for a lengthy period, it's important to consider which medications not only work well but also ideally have few side effects.
                            Specific kinds of talk therapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), psychodynamic psychotherapy, or interpersonal therapy (IPT), are known to be effective forms of psychotherapy that treat PDD."

                With cyclothymic disorder, you have low-grade high periods (hypomanias) as well as brief, fleeting periods of depression that don't last as long (less than 2 weeks at a time) as in a major depressive episode.

                Symptoms of Cyclothymic Disorder:
                                        Episodes that involve brief, recurrent periods of depression and, at other times, episodes of hypomania; this pattern of episodes must be present for at least 2 years.
                                        Symptoms that persist, creating fewer than 2 symptom-free months in a row.
                Treatment:
                    Cyclothymic disorder may not respond as well to medications as does bipolar disorder. A combination of mood stabilizers and psychotherapy is most effective. 
                    Mood stabilizers include antiseizure drugs such as carbamazepine (Tegretol), devalproex (Depakote), lithium, or lamotrigine (Lamictal))."

                These short-lasting sudden movements (motor tics) or uttered sounds (vocal tics) occur suddenly during what is otherwise normal behavior. 
                Tics are often repetitive, with numerous successive occurrences of the same action. For instance, someone with a tic might blink their eyes multiple times or twitch their nose repeatedly.
                Motor tics can be classified as either simple or complex. Simple motor tics may include movements such as eye-blinking, nose-twitching, head-jerking, or shoulder-shrugging. 
                Complex motor tics consist of a series of movements performed in the same order. For instance a person might reach out and touch something repeatedly or kick out with one leg and then the other.
                Twitches: Unlike tics, the majority of muscle twitches are isolated occurrences, not repeated actions. Muscle twitches are also known as myoclonic jerks. They are entirely involuntary and cannot be controlled or suppressed.
                One type of muscle twitch is benign essential blepharospasm. Blepharospasm refers to the muscles of one or both eyelids twitching uncontrollably. 
                This often occurs repeatedly over a sustained period of time. In extreme cases, which are rare, benign essential blepharospasm may also involve the eyebrows, mouth, and neck."
